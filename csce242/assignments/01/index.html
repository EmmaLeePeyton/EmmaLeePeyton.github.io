        <h1>&#10043; Fiber Arts &#10043;</h1>
        <p>
            Fiber arts is a form of art in relation to to creating pieces 
            using materials such as yarn or fabric. I will be primarily speaking 
            about the yarn side of fiber arts because I am personally accoustomed 
            to this. I dabble in crochet and knitting in my free time. Fiber 
            arts tends to use more synthetic materials because it is cheaper to 
            produce and buy. You can however get 100% cotton or bamboo yarns at
            reasonable prices.
        </p>
        <p>
            Something important to familiarize yourself with are the different 
            types of yarn weights and the sizes of hooks/needles. There are several 
            yarn types as well as "weights". weights are what we refer to the 
            thickness the yarn is. It can also come in different styles to fit all 
            types of projects in colors and textures. The different needle sized 
            are measured in millimeters (mm).
        </p>

            I thought about putting them as figure and giving them captions, 
                but I figured that would be more CSS.
