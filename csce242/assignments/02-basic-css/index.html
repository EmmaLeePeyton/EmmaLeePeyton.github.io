            Trains have come a long way since their early models. Most to all of us have certainly 
            seen a train or a movie that contains a train. Trains were and still are a staple of 
            travel and transport in several countries. The common thought when thinking about 
            trains here in Columbia, SC is a mild to major inconvenience.

            Trains can be quite wonderful when you ride in them though. They provide a comfortable 
            way of travel by land. While on the train, you could take a nap, eat a snack, catch 
            up on those pesky emails, or watch a movie that takes place on a train. Trains can be 
            quite relaxing when you ride on them.
