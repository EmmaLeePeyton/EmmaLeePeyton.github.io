                        Our users are not aware of the amount of possible fashionable outfits they already have in their own closet. <br>
                        <br>This leads to people buying excessive amounts of clothes, rather than regularly rotating the clothes they already own. <br>
                        <br>Our solution would implement a machine learning algorithm to put together outfits from already owned clothes for users. <br>
                        <br>This allows our users to have more outfits without buying more clothes.<br>

                        My group and I brainstormed on what we want our app to do. <br>
